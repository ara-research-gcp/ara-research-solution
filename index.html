        <h2>Built on Google Cloud</h2>
        <p>
          The solution is designed and operated on Google Cloud to achieve security,
          scalability, and rapid iteration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Vertex AI</strong> powers custom conversational and decision models that
            assess affordability, simulate repayment scenarios, and recommend personalized,
            sustainable plans.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dialogflow CX</strong> provides structured, multi-turn dialogue flows for
            inbound and outbound conversations across web, mobile, and messaging channels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloud Run</strong> and <strong>Cloud Functions</strong> orchestrate
            asynchronous workflows for message delivery, webhook handling, and integration with
            loan management systems and payment gateways.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>BigQuery</strong> and <strong>Cloud SQL</strong> store and process
            operational and financial data, enabling analytics on portfolio performance,
            repayment behaviour, and agent effectiveness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloud Storage</strong> and <strong>Secret Manager</strong> are used for
            secure file storage, configuration, and key management, with encryption in transit
            and at rest.
          </li>

      <section id="architecture">
        <h2>High-Level Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Frontend channels (web, mobile, messaging) connect to Ara’s API layer running on
          Cloud Run. Incoming events are routed to Dialogflow CX and Vertex AI models, which
          determine the next best action: offer, negotiation path, or escalation. Workflow
          logic is implemented through Cloud Functions that interact with external lender
          systems, payment processors, and data sources. Aggregated interaction and repayment
          data is streamed into BigQuery for reporting and analytics, enabling continuous
          improvement of models and strategies.
